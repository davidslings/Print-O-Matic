# Print-O-Matic
Print-O-Matic is a Java application that serves as the final assignment for the Java foundation course. 

The application enables users to 
- create a user account
- add items to the basket
- review the order information
- edit user and/or shopping cart info
- calculate pickup time.
- export order to json file

# Requirements 
- The user needs to input either the id or name of the item to put it in the order.
- The user needs to be able to modify or add multiple items to the order.
- The user needs to be able to modify or add customer information for the order.
- The user needs to be able to create an invoice.
  - On the invoice, the entire order's total cost must be shown.
  - On the invoice, the completion time needs to be shown.
  - The pickup date and time need to be within the store's opening hours.
  - Keep in mind that PhotoShop only has one printer, so orders should stack accordingly.
- The shopping cart needs to be saved to and retrieved from either XML or Json. So that old orders can be reviewed.
- Use the CSV files for the opening hours and the price list.
- The program needs to be made completely in the command log.

# Considerations  
- Make sure you put sufficient comments in your code.
- Apply inheritance, for example, the order can inherit from a photo. 
- Use the naming conventions correctly and consistently.
- Make sure your code is efficient, readable, extendable and maintainable.
- Your grandma should be able to use your application, so make sure is clear and easy to use.
